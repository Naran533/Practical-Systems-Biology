## Simulate the trajectories of the third protein (p3) in a negative-feedback model
# Fixed value: b and six different maximum rate of transcription values (a)
# In the genetic oscillator model, inputs are:
#   initial concentration of mRNA (mi)
#   repressor encoded by mRNA (pi)
#   time units (t)
#   and ratio of mRNA to protein lifetimes (b)
